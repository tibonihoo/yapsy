Next Refactoring

- code: consider making the filter and versionned plugin into plugin manager child classes (instead of decorators), err or maybe strategies ?
- code: find a correct design to make extending the plugin "loading" easier and chainable (policies/mixins, traits ?)
- code: [feature req.] Reloadable configuration for plugins
- code: [feature req.] Allow Decorators to extend gatherPluginInfo
